## Installation

### Dependencies

First, make sure you have all those things installed:

- `git`: to clone the repo
- `curl`: to download some stuff
- `tar`: to extract downloaded stuff
- `fish`: the shell
- `sudo`: some configs may need that

### Install

Then, run these steps:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles.fish.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./script/bootstrap.fish
```

> All changed files will be backed up with a `.backup` suffix.

#### Update

To update, you just need to `git pull` and run the bootstrap script again:

```console
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ git pull origin master
$ ./script/bootstrap.fish
```

## Revert

Reverting is not totally automated, but it pretty much consists in removing
the fish config and dotfiles folder, as well as moving back some config files.

**Remove the folders:**

```console
$ rm -rf ~/.dotfiles ~/.config/fish
```

**Some config files were changed, you can find them using `fd`:**

```console
$ fd -e backup -e local -H -E Library -d 3 .
```

And then manually inspect/revert them.

## Recommended Software

For macOS, I recommend:

- iTerm: a better terminal emulator;

For both Linux and macOS:

- [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) a `cat` with wings;
- [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for better git diffs;
- [`dog`](https://dns.lookup.dog) the command-line DNS client;
- [`exa`](https://the.exa.website) a modern replacement for `ls`;
- [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`;
- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for a fuzzy-finder, used in `,t` on vim, for example;
- [`gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli) for more GitHub integration with the terminal;
- [`grc`](https://github.com/garabik/grc) to colorize command's outputs;
- [`starship.rs`](https://starship.rs) the shell we are using;
- [`kubectx`](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) for better Kubernetes context and namespace switch;
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) a faster `grep`;

To install them all with `brew`:

```console
$ brew install fish bat git-delta dog exa fd fzf gh grc kubectx ripgrep starship
```

On Ubuntu:

```console
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh)"
sudo apt install fish grc fzf
```

## macOS defaults

You use it by running:

```console
~/.dotfiles/macos/set-defaults.sh
```

And logging out and in again or restart.
