---

Forked from my [ZSH dotfiles](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles), these are
my Fish Shell config files, together with editor, macOS configs and other
goodies.

## Installation

### Dependencies

First, make sure you have all those things installed:

- `git`: to clone the repo
- `curl`: to download some stuff
- `tar`: to extract downloaded stuff
- `fish`: the shell
- `sudo`: some configurations may need that

### Install

Then, run these steps:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles.fish.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./script/bootstrap.fish
```

> All changed files will be backed up with a `.backup` suffix.

#### Update

To update, you just need to `git pull` and run the bootstrap script again:

```console
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ git pull origin master
$ ./script/bootstrap.fish
```

## Revert

Reverting is not totally automated, but it pretty much consists in removing the
fish configuration and the `.dotfiles` folder, as well as moving back some other
configuration files:

```console
$ rm -rf ~/.dotfiles $__fish_config_dir
```

The bootstrap script would have created a bunch of symbolic links that will now
be broken. You will have to investigate those manually. In cases a file already
existed, the `script/bootstrap.fish` script should have created a `.backup` file
with the same name.
